            <p>Digital literacy is the ability to use digital technologies effectively and responsibly. It includes understanding how to use computers, smartphones, the internet, and other digital tools to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information.Social media literacy refers to the ability to critically evaluate and navigate social media platforms effectively.

			Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting internet-connected systems, including hardware, software, and data, from cyber threats.
            It involves measures such as antivirus software, firewalls, encryption, and regular software updates to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and malware infections.
            Best practices include using strong, unique passwords, being cautious of phishing attempts, avoiding suspicious websites and links, and keeping sensitive information secure.
